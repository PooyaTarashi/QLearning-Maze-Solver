# Q-Learning Project

## Description
This project implements **Q-Learning**, a reinforcement learning algorithm used for decision-making in environments with discrete states and actions. The algorithm enables an agent to learn an optimal policy by interacting with an environment and updating a Q-table based on rewards received.

## Features
- Implements Q-Learning from scratch in Python.
- Supports a grid-based environment where an agent navigates toward a goal.
- Uses an **ε-greedy policy** for balancing exploration and exploitation.
- Includes customizable parameters like learning rate (α), discount factor (γ), and exploration rate (ε).
- Supports training and evaluation phases.
- Visualizes the learned policy.

Modify hyperparameters like `alpha`, `gamma`, and `epsilon` in the script to see how they affect learning.
